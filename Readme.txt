RYL Character Tool

This is a little tool that I made to help me to easyli find out what "build" I would use for my char on the RYL (Risk Your Life) MMORPG.


What it does?

Basically it will show how many of each stat (STR, CON, DEX, WIS, INT) your character have at each level.
All in game classes are supported by the tool.


Development

This tool was developted in C# (using .NET Framework 2.0), I started the 1.0 version in the year of 2008, after that the tool was updated some times, including new features and correcting some little bugs.

I made a 2.1 version of the tool, where the user could also select the Skills he would like to use in his char.

This 2.1 version is available at some places, but unfortunatly the cake here lost the source code due to a HD crash :(, that is why now I will try to have all my project oh GH :D.

With a new RYL Server coming out it was necessary to update the tool, but since I didn't had the v2.1 source code anymore, I needed to get an older version (1.3) of the tool and start to update it again to the features available in this new server.
